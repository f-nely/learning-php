        Arrays
        A collection of data that acts as key-value pairs
        Arrays are great for complex data sets.

        Types of arrays
        - Indexable arrays (which use numbered keys).
        - Associative arrays (which use strings as keys).

        Important to know
        Arrays index the start at 0, not 1.

        Associative array
        Allows you to turn the numbered index into a string.

        Multidimensional arrays
